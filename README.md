a. High Income, High Spending Score 


b. High Income, Low Spending Score


c. Average Income, Average Spending Score


d. Low Income, High Spending Score


e. Low Income, Low Spending Score

The position of the clusters and their respective types are mentioned in the code file.

# Observations:

b. High Income, Low Spending Score (Cluster 3) - Target these customers by asking the feedback and advertising the product in a better way to convert them into Cluster 5 customers.


c. Average Income, Average Spending Score (Cluster 2) - Can target these set of customers by providing them with Low cost EMI's etc.


d. Low Income, High Spending Score (Cluster 1) - May or may not target these group of customers based on the policy of the mall.
